                <h1 class="centruoti">History of Programming</h1><br>

                <p>I started programming 5 years ago, my first touch with programming was robotics camp, where we were building mini robots from Lego and programming their chip for certain moves to make, when we done each teams robots were fighting.<br>
                Then in 9th school class I chose IT class, where in first Year we were learning about computer itself.<br>
                Next year our school was elected and we won Android Studio lessons, so there I learned to program with Android Studio.<br>
                In last 2 years of school we were learning to program with C++ in 'Code:Blocks'.<br><br>

                And in these last school years I've got attracted by programming.<br><br>
                
                I felt that I like to learn programming, but I felt that I still narrowly know programming ocean so I chose to study courses where we introduced to programming widely.<br>
                In University we are taught about Internet, How Computer Works, Databases, Front and Back End programming and about Business<br><br>
                
                My first Website was built in University, in portfolio I have shown him... Not very eye-catching.<br>
                However, it lighted up inside me desire to learn more and more about web development. Then I started to spent my free time to aquire more knowledge.<br>
                Then WiseTeam company decided to re-build their website and there my web development excitement starts.<br>
                Together with a colleague we built it and then our partners IK Konsultacijos also asked to build a website for them and lastly we created for ourself one more website called Soft Consulting.<br><br>
                
                This experience uplifted me and now I am excited to learn more, to know more and ofcourse to build more!</p><br>
